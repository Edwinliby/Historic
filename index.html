                        was built during 1565-1573 for Mughal Emperor Akbar. It was the main residence of the rulers of
                        Sikarwar clan of Rajputs until mughals occupied it and Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital
                        was shifted from Agra to Delhi. It was also known as the “Lal-Qila”, “Fort Rouge” or
                        “Qila-i-Akbari”.[1] Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were
                        the Marathas.

                        itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from
                        1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned
                        in 1610.
